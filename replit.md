# RoofTracer - US Roofing Permits Map

## Overview

RoofTracer is a production-ready mapping platform that ingests and visualizes roofing permit data from public open data portals across the United States. The application pulls data from Socrata SODA APIs and ArcGIS Feature Services, normalizes it to a BLDS-style schema, and presents it on an interactive map with advanced filtering capabilities. Its core purpose is to provide transparency and insights into roofing construction activity by aggregating publicly available building permit data in a unified, searchable interface.

Key capabilities include automated ingestion, intelligent roofing classification, interactive map visualization with clustering, and an administrative interface for data source management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript using Vite. It utilizes Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS, following Material Design 3 principles. TanStack Query manages server state and API interactions. MapLibre GL JS provides interactive map visualization with OpenStreetMap tiles and client-side clustering. All filters, map bounds, and selected permits are synchronized with URL query parameters for shareability. The design prioritizes a map-centric layout, URL as the source of truth, optimistic UI updates, and a responsive, mobile-first approach.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is an Express.js application with TypeScript on Node.js. It uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless driver) for type-safe database queries. The API is RESTful, organized by resources like `/api/sources`, `/api/permits`, and `/api/status`. A pluggable connector architecture supports Socrata, ArcGIS, and Accela platforms, with an interface for `validate()`, `backfill()`, `incremental()`, and `normalize()` operations. The system includes rate limiting with exponential backoff and data normalization with fingerprinting for deduplication, YAML-based roofing classification rules, and structured address parsing. Centralized error handling provides consistent API responses.

### Data Storage

The primary database is PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), chosen for its JSON/JSONB support, potential for spatial extensions, and scalability. The schema is BLDS-inspired, featuring `permits` (with provenance, classification, and geographic data), `sources` (configuration and budget controls), and `source_state` tables (tracking sync status and errors). Indexing is applied to `fingerprint`, `(lat, lon)`, `issue_date`, `is_roofing`, and `source_id` for optimized querying. Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations.

### Authentication & Authorization

Currently, no authentication is required as all data is publicly sourced and viewable. Future considerations for user accounts would involve NextAuth.js and row-level security.

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production (Railway)

**`ACCELA_USE_PLAYWRIGHT`** - Set to `true` to enable live Playwright scraping for Accela sources
- **Default:** Not set (uses demo fixture data)
- **Production:** `true` (enables real permit scraping)
- **Location:** Railway Dashboard → Variables tab

**Database Variables** - Automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL addon
- `DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`

**Session Secret** - Auto-generated by Railway
- `SESSION_SECRET`

### Local Development

Create a `.env` file in the project root (already gitignored):

```env
ACCELA_USE_PLAYWRIGHT=true
```

## Railway Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Railway account connected to GitHub
- PostgreSQL addon provisioned
- Environment variables configured

### Deployment Steps

1. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables
   Add: ACCELA_USE_PLAYWRIGHT = true
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Docker deployment with Playwright"
   git push
   ```

3. **Railway Auto-Deploy**
   - Railway detects `Dockerfile` and builds using Docker
   - Build time: ~5-10 minutes (includes Playwright browsers)
   - Automatic deployment on success

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Visit Railway URL → Should show map
   - Navigate to `/sources` → See all 6 data sources
   - Click "Backfill" on any source → Starts ingestion
